# Peri-Care
Peri-care is a work in progress mobile application to allow operation patients to easily communicate with their doctors, and receive relevant information and reminders regarding their medication and recovery process. The app allows patients to seamlessly fit the operation care plan given by a physician (through scanning a QR code) into their daily life through their phone.
